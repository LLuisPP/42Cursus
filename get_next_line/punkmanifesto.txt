PUNKS ARE NOT BEASTS:
Violence is neither common in, nor unique to punk. 
IN UNIQUENESS IS THE PRESERVATION OF MANKIND:
Nature bestowed on us the genetic backbone of what punk is all about.
There are roughly 80,000 genes in the human genome, and there are roughly 6 billion people carrying that genetic compliment. The chances of two people carrying the same genome are so small as to be almost beyond comprehension (the odds are essentially 80,000 times the number of possible people you can meet and mate with in a lifetime! A practical impossibility).
